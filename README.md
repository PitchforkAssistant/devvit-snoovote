# SnooVote

SnooVote is a Devvit app created for the Mod World 2024 demo.

It that adds a custom post type to your subreddit where users can create and vote on polls using the position of their own Snoovatars.

New votes can be created and posted using a button found in the subreddit dropdown menu.

Moderators have additional options to manage, edit, and freeze votes.

This project's [source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/PitchforkAssistant/devvit-snoovote).
